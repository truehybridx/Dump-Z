# Dump-Z
This is a droppable UI for [class-dump-z](https://code.google.com/archive/p/networkpx/wikis/class_dump_z.wiki).

## Motivation
I build this application to give a helping hand to those getting into the reverse engineering and tweaking scenes in iOS Development. This provides an easy means to just drop the Mach-O binary in the application and have the class headers dumped for review.

## Features
* Droppable interface for Mach-O binaries to dump class headers.

## Installation
1. Download and Install Xcode
2. Clone this repository
3. Open and Build the project
